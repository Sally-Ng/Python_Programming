# Python Programming
The course covers programming fundamentals using the Python language to write programs that perform various tasks including manipulating numerical and textual information; accessing content in files; transferring information to and from web sites. Topics include writing object-oriented programs using classes and objects, describing the Python operators for manipulating lists, dictionaries, tuples and files, and creating useful stand-alone and CGI applications.
